# LU Factorization

## About

This project implements LU Factorization with partial pivoting for solving linear systems of equations. LU Factorization is an efficient way of generating matrices for re-use with the same system.

## Versioning

**VERSION:** 1.0

**RELEASE:** N/A

**LAST UPDATED:** October 17th, 2018

## Resources

**LUfact.c:** Contains the implementation of LU Factorization given an input system in matrix form.

**LUfact.h:** Contains all structures and prototypes required to implement **LUfact.c**.

**LUtest.c:** Written by Paul Bonamy in the Computer Science Department, WSUV for the purpose of testing the correctness of **LUfact.c**.

**Makefile:** Makefile for building and running the system.

## How To Use

To use the system:
1. Run `make` to compile the system.
2. Run `make run` to run the system and view the results of **LUtest.c** using **LUfact.c** to solve a series of test matrices.
3. Run `make clean` to clean up any executables.

## Future Development

No future development is planned at this time.
